# Northwestern Mutual Interview Project

This application is a basic archive system. It will allow you to create an inventory of household items. These items can be anything that you would like cataloged in your household(eg: movies, cleaning supplies, clothing).

I will be using several new technologies including the Python back-end and the React front-end.



### Technologies:

* Back-End:
  * Python
  * Flask

* Front-End:
  * JavaScript
  * React
  * Bootstrap

### To do:
- [ ] Back-end

  - [ ] Route endpoints to 'views' (.../client/'location')
  - [ ] create endpoints list based on user stories
  - [ ] document API ENDPOINTS

  - [ ] connect back end to front end - learn<a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/12/20/crud-app-with-python-flask-react">
here</a>

- [ ] Front-end:
  - [ ] Initialize React app
  - [ ] Add Bootstrap for styles
  - [ ] Consume RESTful Python API
  - [ ] Create components to fullfil user stories
 

### User Stories

- [ ]  As a User, I want to be able to see a list of movies - /GET/ALL MOVIES
